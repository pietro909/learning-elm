# Welcome to my elm dojo
## This is the place where I learn

* *first-tutorial* contains the first steps I moved with elm, using [the online docs](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)
* *elm-in-action* contains all the code I'm writing while studying [Elm in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action)

Happy elm!
Pietro
